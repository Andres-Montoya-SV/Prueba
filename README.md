# Any Language is OK
**Recommended PHP / NODEJS / PYTHON**

## Requirements:

1. Given the following JSON Data as the source: https://rss.applemarketingtools.com/api/v2/us/music/most-played/10/albums.json

## Develop a solution to the given requirements.

● Create a repository on Github.

● Create an API that has the following endpoints:
        ● A service to provide a search lookup within the podcasts (at least by name, but is open to any suggestions)
        
        ● A service that would allow saving the top 20 podcasts to a separate JSON File
        
        ● A service to replace the top 20 podcasts for the bottom 20 to said JSON File
        
        ● A service to remove a podcast, using a given identifier (defined by you)

● Bonus!
        ● Use a Database (suggested: SQLite), instead of the JSON File. Include a create schema in the repo and instructions on how to implement it.
        
        ● Add authentication API endpoint(s)
        
        ● Create a service to return the podcasts grouped by genres, even if they appear as duplicates within some of the categories.

## Make Sure that:

● You do not make one single commit, please leave enough proof of your code, and detail of the steps taken to complete the solution.

● Try to optimize your code, but also keep quality in mind.

● The requirements have been structured in such a way that you can engineer the best solution you consider as adequate, but feel free to ask any questions you may have, do not hesitate in reaching out to clarify anything that comes to your mind.

● Please provide the information/steps so I can run your solution, entirely.

2. Create a Wordpress site that will display the podcasts(using BeaverBuilder).
